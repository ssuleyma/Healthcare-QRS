# Healthcare QRS Analysis
This repository performs ECG analysis to detect QRS complexes and their duration. As the data is bening analyzed, waveform graphs and numerical metrics are displayed to monitor the healthcare metrics of the patient.

The data contains recordings of multiple physiologic signals ("waveforms") and time series of vital signs ("numerics") collected from bedside patient monitors.

A normal ECG heart signal consists of a periodic pattern. Different points in a signal period of this pattern are labeled as P,Q,R,S and T.

The QRS complex corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left verticles og the human heart. If they are working efficiently, the QRS complex is 0.08-0.12 seconds in duration, which can be shorter for kids.
